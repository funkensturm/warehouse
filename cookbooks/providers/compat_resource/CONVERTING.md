Converting cookbooks from the old resource model to the new
===========================================================

Boilerplate
-----------

1. Depend on compat_resource
   - Descend resources from ChefCompat::Resource
   - Set resource_name in the class instead of the constructor
2. Convert Attributes to Properties
   - Rename attribute -> property
   - Move set_or_return -> property
   - Take kind_of/equal_to/regexes and make them types
   - Use true/false/nil instead of TrueClass/FalseClass/NilClass
   - Remove default: nil (it's the default)
3. Convert Top-Level Providers to Actions
   - Create any resources that don't already exist (for example in
     multi-provider cases) and descend from the base resource
   - Remove allowed_actions / @actions
   - @action -> default_action
   - Move `provides` and `action :x` to the resource
   - Remove use_inline_resources and def whyrun_safe?
   - Move other methods to `action_class.class_eval do`

Now you have everything in a resource, are using properties, and have gotten rid
of a bunch of boilerplate. Of course, this is just getting it *moved*.

Advanced Concepts
-----------------

1. Resource Inheritance
2. Resources That Are Different On Each OS?
3. Coercion: Handling User Input
4. Lazy Defaults
5. Using Load Current Resource
6. Using Converge If Changed
7. Defaults Are For Creation
8. Shared types: using a type multiple places
